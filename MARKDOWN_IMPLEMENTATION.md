# Markdown/HTML Rendering Implementation

## Overview
Both EduBot and RevisionBot now support **animated markdown rendering** with typewriter effects. The AI responses are displayed with rich formatting including:

- **Headers** (H1, H2, H3)
- **Bold** and *italic* text
- `Code blocks` and inline code
- > Blockquotes
- Lists (ordered and unordered)
- And more markdown features

## Features

### 1. Animated Markdown Widget
Located at: `lib/widgets/animated_markdown.dart`

#### Key Components:

**AnimatedMarkdown**
- Animates markdown text character by character
- Typewriter effect at 20ms per character (configurable)
- Tap to skip animation and show full text immediately
- Selectable text for copy/paste
- Automatic markdown rendering with proper styling

**StaticMarkdown**
- Renders complete markdown instantly (no animation)
- Used for previously sent messages
- Same styling as animated version
- Selectable text

### 2. Implementation Details

#### In Both Chatbots:
The logic checks if a message is the **latest AI response**:
- If YES → Use `AnimatedMarkdown` (with typewriter effect)
- If NO → Use `StaticMarkdown` (instant rendering)

```dart
// Latest AI message gets animation
(index == geminiApi.chat.length - 1 &&
    geminiApi.chat[index]['role'] == 'model')
    ? AnimatedMarkdown(...)
    : StaticMarkdown(...)
```

### 3. Markdown Styling

Both components support:
- **Dark Mode**: Optimized colors for dark backgrounds
- **Light Mode**: Clean styling for light backgrounds
- **Code Blocks**: Special formatting with gray background
- **Headers**: Size scaling (H1 = 1.6x, H2 = 1.4x, H3 = 1.2x)
- **Lists**: Properly formatted bullets and numbers
- **Emphasis**: Bold and italic text support

### 4. User Interaction

- **Tap to Skip**: Users can tap on animating text to see the full response immediately
- **Selectable Text**: All rendered markdown is selectable for copy/paste
- **Smooth Animation**: 20ms per character provides smooth reading experience

## Usage

### For AI Responses with Markdown:
The Gemini API automatically returns markdown-formatted text for:
- Code examples with ` ``` ` blocks
- Lists with `-` or `1.`
- Headers with `#`, `##`, `###`
- Bold text with `**text**`
- Italic text with `*text*`

### Example Markdown Responses:

```markdown
# Chapter 1: Introduction

Here's how to calculate the area:

1. Measure the **length**
2. Measure the *width*
3. Multiply them together

## Formula
The formula is: `Area = length × width`

> **Note**: Make sure to use the same units!
```

## Benefits

✅ **Rich Formatting**: Better readability with proper text hierarchy
✅ **Code Highlighting**: Clear code blocks for technical content
✅ **Maintained Animation**: Keeps the engaging typewriter effect
✅ **User Control**: Tap to skip animation when needed
✅ **Copy-Friendly**: All text is selectable
✅ **Consistent Styling**: Works in both dark and light modes

## Technical Notes

- The widget uses `flutter_markdown` package (already in dependencies)
- Custom animation logic built with `StatefulWidget` and `Future.delayed`
- No performance impact compared to plain text rendering
- Graceful degradation: if markdown syntax isn't used, displays as plain text

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- [ ] Image rendering support
- [ ] LaTeX math equation support
- [ ] Custom link handling
- [ ] Adjustable animation speed in settings
